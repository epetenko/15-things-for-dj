# 15 things you can do in 15 minutes to step up your data journalism game

When teaching local journalists about data reporting, many have expressed an interest in what you can do with data, but they resoundingly have the same complaint: "I don't have time for this."

I don't blame them. Journalists are under more pressure than ever these days to multitask and fill stories by the deadline. And data journalism, while rich in returns, seems to require a big learning curve.

But what if I told you there are some things you can do _today_ that will build up to a data story tomorrow? And these things don't require any skills or knowledge about data whatsoever?

Set up some of these today, and you'll find a lot of data story options coming down the road.

**10. Look up a local doctor (or official, or charity) in Propublica's databases.**
Propublica has a number of news applications to assist reporters in doing their job. My favorites include 
 - [Dollars for Docs](https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/), which has doctor's payments from drug companies
 - [Treatment tracker](https://projects.propublica.org/treatment/), what meds has that doctor been giving out?
 - [Nonprofit explorer](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/), look up charities, universities, health systems and more
 - [Has your school been investigated for civil rights violations?](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/civil-rights-violations)
 - [The FEC itemizer](https://projects.propublica.org/itemizer/) and [Represent](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/)
