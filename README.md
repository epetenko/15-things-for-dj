# 15 things you can do in 15 minutes to step up your data journalism game

When teaching local journalists about data reporting, many have expressed an interest in what you can do with data, but they resoundingly have the same complaint: "I don't have time for this."

I don't blame them. Journalists are under more pressure than ever these days to multitask and fill stories by the deadline. And data journalism, while rich in returns, seems to require a big learning curve.

But what if I told you there are some things you can do _today_ that will build up to a data story tomorrow? And these things don't require any skills or knowledge about data whatsoever?

Set up some of these today, and you'll find a lot of data story options coming down the road.

**14. Check out the censusreporter.org entry for your town**

**13. Go to Steve's [data warehouse](http://sstirling.github.io/data-toolbox/build/subject/data.html) and Data Is Plural's [spreadsheet of data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0). Ctrl+F your subject or topic of interest.**

If you're looking for some inspiration, IRE has a tipsheet of [50 things you can FOIA right now](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_tDuq-l531HZ5OLuhH5lQwgqm2kCxMNfZo4XrvL1biA/edit#gid=0).

**10. Look up a local doctor (or official, or charity) in Propublica's databases.**         
Propublica has a number of news applications to assist reporters in doing their job. My favorites include 
 - [Dollars for Docs](https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/), which has doctor's payments from drug companies
 - [Treatment tracker](https://projects.propublica.org/treatment/), what meds has that doctor been giving out?
 - [Nonprofit explorer](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/), look up charities, universities, health systems and more
 - [Has your school been investigated for civil rights violations?](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/civil-rights-violations)
 - [The FEC itemizer](https://projects.propublica.org/itemizer/) and [Represent](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/) for looking up your Congressional representative
 
**9. Sign up for IRE/NICAR (and the NICAR-L listserv)**      
Data journalists like to talk to each other, especially when an Excel problem is involved. NICAR is one of the biggest resources we have to chat and share our ideas. IRE/NICAR has video tutorials, conference tipsheets and audio, and the NICAR-L listserv where data journos ask questions and share projects throughout the year. The [IRE 2018 conference](https://ire.org/conferences/ire-2018/tipsheets/) has tipsheets designed for daily journalists to get into data journalism.

**8. Follow these outlets and and aggregators**      
If you're looking to get some inspiration, I've collected a number of favorite places to see the latest data visualizations and big projects. These may not all be available to the local reporter, but they can help you see what's in the realm of possibility.
